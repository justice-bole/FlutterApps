# Clima ‚òÅ

## The Goal

The objective of this application is to implement asynchronous programming in Dart. Async programming helps to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What's Clima?

A weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). Using that app, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of.

## How it Works

- Uses Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
- Implements async and await.
- Extensive use of Futures.
- Networking uses the Dart http package.
- Uses OpenWeather API to get weather data from the internet.
- Uses JSON and parses JSON using the Dart convert package.
- Passes data back afd forth screens using the Navigator.
- Implements exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
- Leverages Stateful Widgets and overrides.
- The Geolocator package gets live location data for both iOS and Android.
- TextField Widget gets user input.
