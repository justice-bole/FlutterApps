# BMI Calculator

## The Goal

The objective of this application is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a beautiful user interface design.


## What's BMI Calculator?

A Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It's a multi-screen app with simple functionality but with custom styling.

## How it Works

- Uses Flutter themes to create a coherent branding. 
- Implements multiple pages using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- Uses the GestureDetector Widget to detect a variety of user inputs.
- Uses custom color palettes by using hex codes.
- Customized Flutter Widgets achieve a specific design style.
- Implements Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Uses composition over inheritance when creating custom UI widgets.
