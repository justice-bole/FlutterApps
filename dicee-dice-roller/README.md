## How it Works

- Uses stateless widgets for the UI design.
- Uses stateful widgets to update the UI.
- Implements onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- Leverages setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- Applies the Expanded widget to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Makes use of string interpolation.
- Employs gesture controls.
